# FYS-STK4155


## Repository of FYS-STK4155 course
###### Fall 2020 at University of Oslo

This repository contains worked projects from this course. This course is mainly about applied data analysis and machine learning.

###### Project 1
Analysis of the different Linear regression methods such as
* Ordinary least squares,
* Ridge regression,
* Lasso regression.

As well as resampling methods applied on the methods above such as cross validation and bootstrap.

These methods will also be applied onto real terrain data. 

###### Project 2
Analysis of SGD methods and Feed Foward Neural Network(FFNN) as regressor and classifier.
The FFNN is used as a regressor on the Franke function, as a classifier of the MNIST dataset.


###### Project 3
In this project, Wisconsin breast cancer data were used for this numerical study.
Two feature selection methods were used on this dataset. The first being Recursive Feature Elimination and the second being feature reduction by removing features with correlation factor. 

The classifiers used was
* Feed Forward Neural Network
* AdaBoost
